The simulation uses two pheromone trails which are distinguished by color. The pheromone trails appear to be static (i.e. no fading over time.

BREVE distinguishes itself from other simulation packages by claiming to facilitate faster development of novel simulations through a - specifically for BREVE designed - custom object-oriented programming language developed with the intention of reducing programmer overhead.

One approach at visualizing the swarm graphs where all the particles are each generation, thus demonstrating the random nature associated with swarms of insects. Another approach is to show successive bests, thus showing the way that the swarm progresses. Some have even looked at the specific search path of the particle that eventually finds the optima. These approaches provide limited understanding of PSO. This paper presents a new visualization approach based on the probability distribution of the swarm, thus the random nature of PSO is properly visualized. The visualization allows better understanding of how to tune the algorithm and depicts weaknesses. A new algorithm based on moving the swarm a Gaussian distance from the global and local best is presented. Gaussian particle swarm optimization (GPSO) is compared to PSO.},

annote = {The authors present an extension to particle swarm optimization (PSO) termed Gaussian particle swarm optimization (GPSO). In GPSO, areas around global and local optima are predominately searched by using a Gaussian distribution. The authors mention that this technique is an improvement over PSO, which searches the midpoint area of global and local maxima. However, a definite performance increase was not yet proved. The authors use a histogram or binning technique to visualize the optimization process. The histogram illustrates a two-dimensional space on the x and y axis. The height of the histogram at a particular x-y coordinate indicates the concentration of particles for that cell. Histograms are generated for each generation or time-step of the optimization process showing the overall swarms convergence toward global optima. It appears that the histogram technique would not generalize well to swarms operating in higher-then-two-dimensions. The paper mentions other visualization techniques for PSO, such as plotting the positions of the swarm members and DQ-Scatterplots.}

In this paper, the author demonstrates how self-organization and behavior as seen in Reynolds' Boids can be used to show the change of information over time. This method is dubbed {\em Information Flocking} and combines the flocking behavior rules with clustering techniques to give users a unique perspective of changing data. The sample domain used in this paper is stock prices. The author claims that this visualization technique, although not showing actual data values, is able to convey long-term and short-term temporal similarities within time-varying data sets. Also, this method naturally has the ability to neglect noisy or insignificant data changes. The domain presented in this paper and the method of information flocking are not relevant to our project. However, the visualization of the agents this author uses is incredibly smooth looking and pretty to look at. Each agent is a single particle in 3D and its traveled path is depicted by a colored, curved line that has gradually decreasing opacity from the head. The tails are made smooth by using the {\em Catmull-Rom spline} algorithm, which generates smoother tails than linear interpolation through the previous points the agent has visited. The particles' color shows change in data: blue for a decrease and red for an increase. In addition, the visualization may include an encompassing ``blob'' that shows vicinity (data similarity). That is, if particles are in the same block, they are in the same flock. This blob method also helps the user find outliers.  
These blobs are generated with Marching Cubes; specifically a method called ``implicit surface polygonizer.'' Unfortunately, computing the blob is too computationally intensive to be displayed every time step.  
The author claims that this simulation was able to run in real time with 500 agents.

   annote = {The authors of this paper discuss their research in developing emergence through the use of two distinct evolutionary algorithms.  
Flying agents in a 3D environment are evolved with the desire of consuming virtual energy nodes. The evolutionary algorithms the authors use cause the agents to learn a flocking behavior. The authors argue that their experiments show that flocking is evolutionarily a good trait for survival in simulation (and perhaps the real world).  
Also discuss in detail in the paper is the implementation of the visualization that is done in Breve, a multi-agent and artificial life simulation package for 3D environments. The authors claim that Breve ``simplifies the construction of advanced artificial life and multi- agent simulators.''  The visualizations depict multiple dimensions, other than the spatial ones, by using built-in special effects in Breve such as: shadows, reflections, fog textures, transparency, lightmaps and agent-to-agent lines. In the author's simulation, agents' similarities in species and underlying behavior are shown by a color gradient. Agents themselves are shown as cones that vary in size depending on the distance from the camera, which shows their orientation, direction and position. Also, this paper introduces the idea of leaving agent ``corpses'': if an agent is removed from the simulation or for some reason dies, it leaves behind a dark-colored corpse on the ground-level of the simulation. This adds dramatic effect as well as leaves useful information regarding where the agents are dying off. As future work, the authors discuss using dynamic-line- drawing to visualize agent communication networks in real-time as connections change.}

Although we are not particularly interested in the hardware issues presented in this paper, the authors do discuss some visualization techniques for displaying particles. The authors provide sample output images with particles represented as simple spheres, ellipsoids that show orientation, or arrows that show direction. Also, some visualizations shown introduce color as an indicator of the velocity of the particle. The authors also suggest that you render the particles in sorted order according to the distance to the actor. This way, particles that should be ``in front'' of the other ones are rendered last. The authors also discuss the concept of ``stream ribbons:'' basically a streamline that looks like a ribbon. This has the advantage over streamlines that it shows the rotation of the particle, as well as previous locations.}
