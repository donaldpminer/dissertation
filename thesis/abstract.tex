The behavior of each individual agent in an agent-based model (ABM) is typically well understood because the agents' program has adjustable control parameters that directly modify its behaviors.
What is typically not understood by users of ABMs is explicitly how the values of agent-level control parameters affect the observed
system-level behavior of the ABM.
In effect, modifying the emergent behavior of an ABM is typically reduced to a repetitive and time-consuming process of guess-and-check: select new agent-level parameter values and then observe and evaluate the result.
That is, the controller of the system is forced to use the agent-level parameters which only indirectly affect the system-level behavior.
This process is unintuitive.

This dissertation documents a domain-independent approach for modeling how changes in agent-level control parameters affect the system as a whole, and using this model to enable a user to predict and control the behavior of the system \textit{at the system level}.
The approach is implemented as a learning-based framework, named the \framework,  for defining correlations between agent-level parameter values and quantitative system-level behavior.
Regression methods such as k-nearest neighbor, locally weighted scatterplot smoothing, and nonlinear least squares are used to predict system-level property values, given the system configuration.
The mappings from agent-configuration space to system-level behavior space are then inverted with a novel approach to produce inverted predictions that suggest system configurations, given a desired system-level property values.
The effectiveness and flexibility of the \framework are demonstrated with experiments from four diverse ABMs implemented in NetLogo, a popular multi-agent programmable modeling environment.
